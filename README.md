# Auto_sklearn_Classification
AutoSklearn is a powerful and efficient automated machine learning (AutoML) library. It simplifies the process of building machine learning models by automating tasks such as feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection.

The library is designed to handle various machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, and time series analysis.

In this project, we explore the power of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) using the Breast Cancer and CIFAR-10 datasets. 

## Notebook description
In this repository the notebook ['[Breast_cancer.ipynb'](https://github.com/ilyas4225/Auto_sklearn_Classification/blob/main/Breast_cancer.ipynb)] contains the auto_sklearn image classifier for Breast Cancer dataset.


The Cifar10 notebook ['[Cifar10.ipynb'](https://github.com/ilyas4225/Auto_sklearn_Classification/blob/main/Cifar10.ipynb)] contains the auto sklearn classification with Cifar10 dataset.
